# Glossary

## Principal component analysis (PCA)
> Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Covariance Matrix

## Dimension Reduction

## Linear Combination

## Eigenvector (Singular Vector) 

## Eigenvalue
> Sum of squares of the distances between the projected proints and the origin.

## Scree Plot
> A graphical representation of the percentages of variation that each PC accounts for.

---

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
> The algorithm finds the optimal line for a decision boundarytry while trying to maximize the margin between the two sides
